Usability study:
-Note: User allowed location but the geolocation menu did not appear.
  Possible timeout issue with geolocation function/async

->Enter location
  Location menu was poorly sized on the users screen.

->Select appropriate store
  no Issues.

->Order desired pizza
  Having the menu on the side seems to distract the user
  User frequently hovers over menu on left side as if attempting to get additional information.
  Entering toppings is task
  No easy way to exit menu/change location in chatbot after ordering pizza
  When ordering a pizza without meats/toppings an option for none does not appear
  No option to go back when entering meats/toppings.

->Change your location
  User got stuck on change store. No apparent direction to make this change.

User questions: None
